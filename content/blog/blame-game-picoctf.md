### Introduction
HelloðŸ‘‹ Today we're going to take a look at the challenge Blame Game on PicoCTF by Jeffery John. The difficulty is easy.

### Challenge Description
Someone's commits seems to be preventing the program from working. Who is it? 

You can download the challenge files here:
- [challenge.zip](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_titan/158/challenge.zip)

### Solution
Letâ€™s begin by extracting the contents of the downloaded ```.zip``` file and then navigate to the unzipped directory:
```bash
unzip challenge.zip
cd drop-in/
```

Inside this folder, we notice the presence of a ```.git``` directory, which indicates that Git version control has been initialized. 
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(printnã‰¿printn)-[~/Downloads/drop-in]
â””â”€$ ls -la
total 16
drwxr-xr-x 3 printn printn 4096 Mar 11  2024 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 printn printn 4096 Oct  6 07:24 ..
drwxr-xr-x 8 printn printn 4096 Mar 11  2024 .git
-rw-r--r-- 1 printn printn   22 Mar 11  2024 message.py
```

The challenge description says that someone made a mistake in the code and we must find out who did it. To check all the changes made to the ```message.py``` file in every commit, we can use this command:
```bash
git log -p message.py  
```
This command provides the commit history along with patches, showing the modifications made to the specified file.
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(printnã‰¿printn)-[~/Downloads/drop-in]
â””â”€$ git log -p message.py
